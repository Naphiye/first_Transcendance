    // RGPD
    RGPD: "GDPR",
    rgpdTitle: "Privacy and Data Protection Policy",
    rgpdIntro: "At Transcendance, we take your data privacy very seriously. " +
        "This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect " +
        "your personal information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",

    rgpdSection1Title: "1. Collected Personal Data",
    rgpdSection1Text: `
When you create an account on Transcendance, we only collect the necessary information: username, email, and password.
For accounts created via GitHub, the avatar is imported automatically.

Once the account is created, we may collect and store additional data as you use the app. This includes:
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>the list of friends you add or block</li>
  <li>the current avatar if you change it from 'My Profile'</li>
  <li>your detailed match history, including results, opponents' usernames, organized tournaments, points, and match dates</li>
</ul>
This data is required for the system to function and to personalize your user experience.
`,

    rgpdSection2Title: "2. Public Data Visible to All Users",
    rgpdSection2Text: `
Some profile information is accessible to other users:
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>username</li>
  <li>current avatar</li>
  <li>online/offline status</li>
  <li>your pong statistics (total matches played, tournaments organized, wins and losses)</li>
</ul>
Other users can also view a link to your detailed match history. No other sensitive personal data (email, language, friends) is made public.
`,

    rgpdSection3Title: "3. Technical Data",
    rgpdSection3Text: `
Transcendance does not store persistent technical data online or use it to track users.
Matches are linked only to your account, and no global statistics require storing technical data after deletion or anonymization.
`,

    rgpdSection4Title: "4. Account Anonymization",
    rgpdSection4Text: `
Under GDPR, you can request account anonymization. This deletes all identifying data:
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>email</li>
  <li>username</li>
  <li>avatar</li>
  <li>preferred language</li>
  <li>friend list</li>
  <li>match history</li>
</ul>
After anonymization, the account is no longer identifiable, your public profile and histories disappear, and you cannot log in.
`,

    rgpdSection5Title: "5. Account Deletion",
    rgpdSection5Text: `
You can request complete account deletion at any time. This permanently deletes all the above data and your public profile.
In Transcendance, deletion and anonymization have the same effect: total erasure of personal data.
`,

    rgpdSection6Title: "6. Managing and Controlling Your Data",
    rgpdSection6Text: `
You can manage your data from 'My Profile':
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>view your personal information and public profile with stats and match history</li>
  <li>change your avatar or language</li>
  <li>change your username</li>
  <li>change your email and password if the account was created directly on the site</li>
  <li>delete your account or anonymize your data</li>
</ul>
All these options are accessible from the app.
`,

    rgpdSection7Title: "7. Data Security",
    rgpdSection7Text: `
We take necessary measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, alteration, or accidental exposure.
Your data remains linked to your account and is only used for the app's operation.

For added security, Transcendance offers two-factor authentication (2FA). You can enable it from 'My Profile'.`,

    rgpdSection8Title: "8. User Rights",
    rgpdSection8Text: `
Under GDPR, you have the following rights:
<ul class="list-disc ml-6">
  <li>right of access</li>
  <li>right to rectification</li>
  <li>right to erasure</li>
</ul>
You can exercise these rights via your profile or by contacting the project team at: transcencapy@gmail.com.
`,

    rgpdSection9Title: "9. Policy Updates",
    rgpdSection9Text: `
This policy may be updated if the service evolves. Users will be informed of any significant changes.
